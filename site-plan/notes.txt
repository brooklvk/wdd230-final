Notes from Chamber of Commerce Website feedback: 

- use object-fit: cover for hero image, and place text absolute over image 
- let people know what page they are on (highlight in nav, title on page)
- join form: note that * means required input 
- join form: larger radio buttons for clickability 
- title (of tab) more descriptive and advertising 
- meta descriptions more advertisey and longer 
- more content (like a form) on Contact page 
- didn't do number of visits
